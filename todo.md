# To-do list
- If a digit is pressed after an expression was evaluated, clear the input and output and start a new expression with the aforementioned digit to the expression
- If an operator is pressed after an expression was evaluated, make the old output the first part of a new expression and add the aforementioned operator to the expression
- If an operator is pressed while a complete expression was already in the input, but wasn't evaluated yet, do the following: (1) evaluate the initial expression and show result in output; (2) take the output as the first part of a new expression; (3) add the aforementeioned operator to the expression
- Add spaces between numbers and operators
- Expressions can also be entered via the device's keyboard
- Fix bug where evaluation is incorrect when first number of expression is negative

# Done
- AC button clears the input and the output
- Add an alert when the user tries to divide by 0
- Multiple consecutive operators are not allowed
